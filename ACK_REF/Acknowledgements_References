#Acknowledgements
#I would like to start off by thanking my mentor, Jack Prominski, for all the time and 
#effort he put into helping me through this project. If you are thinking of applying for 
#the BDB Mentorship Program, I would highly suggest it! I would also like to thank all 
#the example kernels that were put out by the Big Data Bowl team.
